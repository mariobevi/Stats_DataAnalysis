Stats and Data Analysis I 

This Project was my 1st approach to analyzing data with Python during my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. The process was to analyze and reach up conclusions of a selected dataset, which in this case was World Happiness. 

This project was awarded the best project of the course and emailed by the professor to use it as an example to future students.
