# Stats_DataAnalysis
Stats and Data Analysis I (2019)

This Project was my 1st approach to analyzing data with Python during my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. The process was to analyze and reach up conclusions of a selected dataset, which in this case was World Happiness and adding 2 extra variables (Type of Government and Continent)

The aim of this analysis was to determine what variables affect the happiness of each of the countries and what makes them happier than others. The sample size is 153 countries, out of which the Dependent Variable is Happiness Score (2017) and 7 Independent Variables including Quantitative and Nominal Variables. 

This project was awarded the best project of the course and emailed by the professor to use it as an example to future students.
